# Bulldozer-sale-Price-Prediction
Overview This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project focused on predicting the sale price of bulldozers. The goal of the project is to build a regression model using scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib that minimizes the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE).

# Key Features
Supervised Regression Model: Utilizes scikit-learn to create a supervised regression model for predicting bulldozer sale prices.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Comprehensive data exploration using pandas and visualization with matplotlib to gain insights into the dataset.

Feature Engineering: Extracts relevant features and preprocesses data to improve model performance.

Evaluation Metric: RMSLE is used as the evaluation metric to quantify the performance of the regression model.

# Project Structure
Data: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.

Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks documenting the EDA, model development, and evaluation.

Src: Python scripts containing modular code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Requirements.txt: Lists the required Python packages for replicating the environment.

# Getting Started
